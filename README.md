# Amateur Hour

Amateur Hour is a website that allows individuals to gain more cred/experience through porfolio pieces, public reviews, or social media presence to practice their crafts and gain a following.

## Background and overview

It can be near impossible for people who have marketable skills (such as photographers, carpenters, gardeners, etc.) but don't have plenty of reviews on sites like Yelp, followings on social media, or a local presense in their area to break into their respective markets. For beginning skilled folks, Amateur Hour allows them to market their services and skills to clients and customers in exchange for recognition and credit to kickstart their businesses.
